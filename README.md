**The spatial measurement system acquires information about the area around the system based upon the press of a single button.**

1. Using a stepping motor to provide a 360 degree measurement of the distance along a single vertical (y-z) geometric plane, with multiple measurements taken at different distances along the x axis. (Constructed using assembly code and C)

2. Upon obtaining the data of the surrounding environment, the information is stored on the microcontroller’s local memory which is communicated to the user’s computer. (Constructed using assembly code and C)

3. After successful communication, the computer will then take the data and process it into a graphic for the user to see. (Constructed using Python)
